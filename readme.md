###Rust BDC

#####The Rust Big-Data Cluster is an attempt to tackle a few personal goals I have set recently:

1. Learn Rust at a deeper level
2. Learn about distributed systems (Gossip Glomers Challenge on Fly.io)
3. Better understand the technical process required to put together a data querying engine -- whether distributed or not -- such as Apache Spark or Polars (after using these services for many years I am fascinated how they actually work behind the scenes)

The purpose of Rust BDC is to act as a play-ground where I can play and tinker with different features and functionality to learn.
